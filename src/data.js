    blog: "This is one of the weirdest landscapes you will ever see. \n A landscape dotted with little green hills with hardly any vegetation growing on them. A local told me the legend of the two fighting giants. A long, long time ago there were two giants arguing about a girl. After a while they started fighting and throwing big rocks at each other. They didn’t bother to clean up after so the landscape was dotted with numerous rocks. You are probably wondering why they are called Chocolate Hills! In the dry season, the grass on the hills will turn brown and they will look like hills made of chocolate.",

    blog: 'A big part of every province in the Philippines is the festivals they celebrate once a year. These festivals either originated from their patron saints or from the legends that came from their place. Colorful parades, finely-created and detailed costumes, street parties, and dance competitions hype up the mood of every festival. Visitors can check out popular festivals like the Sinulog Festival in Cebu City, Panagbenga Festival in Baguio City, Moriones Festival in Marinduque, and Rodeo Festival in Masbate.',
